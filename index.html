    <p class = "updtext">Met the station master at Elphinstone Road station, Mr Anil Gupta (+91-9004498929) who was very supportive of having some sort of dustbin. Explained that the land outside is not within his jurisdiction and asked me to get in touch with the Chief Health Inspector of Western Railway, Mr Brijkishore (+91-9004499514). Met Mr Brijkishore in his offer under the booking office at Lower Parel. Some impressions:</p>
    <ul class="updtext"'>
      <li>is also willing to extend full support but asked to consider the views of the local Western Railway residents as well</li>
      <li>said that the ultimate decision will rest with the BMC. advised that we should start from the bottom up - talk to the collectors who collect the garbage and figure out who to talk to from there</li>
      <li>advised that we need to know <b>where the waste is coming from</b>, <b>what are the garbage collection times from the BMC</b> and <b> the constituents of the garbage</b></li>
      <li>indicated that we might not even need to put any money into as long as we know the right person in the BMC</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="updtext">Back at Elphinstone Road station, we examined the constitutuents of the waste:</p>
    <ul class="updtext">
      <li>grass and mud in a white bag</li>
      <li>big black plastic bag</li>
      <li>vegetables</li>
      <li>peeled and unpeeled lemons</li>
      <li>flowers in plastic bags</li>
      <li>dry generic waste like chivda packs</li>
      <li>chaat plates</li>
      <li>bag of green peas</li>
      <li>leaves mixed with the waste</li>
      <li>plastic chai cups</li>
      <li>wet cardboard</li>
      <li>starbucks cup</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="updtext">Witnessed a young boy chucking a small plastic bag into the pile. When asked if he would throw it into a dustbin if there was one, replied positively.</p>
